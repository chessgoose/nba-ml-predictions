TODO: 


- SQLite to store all 2022-23 data 
- Load in and train XGBoost quantile regression


- Test correlation between EV and predictive accuracy
- Early stopping for NN training
- Combine create_dataset_from_odds and wnba_dataset

- Exploratory data analysis - PCA?

- New features
  - Opponent pace for WNBA (and NBA)
  - Opponent strength (apparently doesnt matter either)
  - Conditional on the game line LOL -- what was the ulimate point differential between the two teams. You can use the Vegas game line as a ground truth game line when making predictions
  
- New approach -- unified SARIMAX model using player-specific exogenous variables... 
   - Regressive based approach that is independent of the line might be more effective 

- Clean up and comment code
    - Pass in "DataLoader" object with more information so you don't have to pass in a bunch of props -- OOP principles
- include other odds for points

- Try fit transform on overall instead of calculting t-statistic

- Long term
    - SQL Database
