TODO: 
- Test correlation between EV and predictive accuracy
- Clean up and comment code
    - Pass in "DataCollection" object with more information so you don't have to pass in a bunch of props -- OOP principles
- include other odds for points

- Train NN 
    - Deploy NN and XG boost to production


- Exploratory data analysis - PCA?

- Feature changes (t-test statistics instead)
    - Remove games with 0 point?
- Try fit transform on overall instead of calculting t-statistic
- Instead of recalculating everything, it might be a good idea to just calculate the new rows 

- Long term
    - SQL Database
