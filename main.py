TODO: 
Data Exploration
- BACKTESTING PROFIT implementation

Software Engineering
- Design frontend interface (once it works consistently)
- Pin ball loss
- include all players from the season and all games -- just use the dataset as a testing dataset and train on the rest LMFAO. this will significantly expand dataset. remove ppg below 5

- Combine create_dataset_from_odds and wnba_dataset
- New features
    - Travel distance between games 

- Clean up and comment code
    - Pass in "DataLoader" object with more information so you don't have to pass in a bunch of props -- OOP principles
- Include other odds for points

- Long term - SQL Databases

BACKLOG
- PCA ? 
- Look at 2022-23 NBA season stats to determine which factors are most useful for predicting points
- Revise scraping methodology to improve consistency
